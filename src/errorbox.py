"""errorbox, by Pete Shinners

Tries multiple python GUI libraries to display an error box
on the screen. No matter what is successful, the error will also
be sent to stdout. For GUI platforms, this can be a lot nicer than
opening a shell with errors dumped into it.

Call the "errorbox()" function with an error title and error message.

The different GUI libraries will leave the program in undefined
states, so this function will never return, but instead end the
program when the error has been dismissed. That makes this only
useful for errors, and not general message boxes.

Feel free to perhaps add some GUI handlers, as well as enhance
any that are here. They have all been tested on their appropriate
platforms.

There is even a decent pygame handler, if all else fails.

Use it to report things like missing modules (image, numeric, etc?).
Perhaps pygame raised an exception while initializing. This little
messagebox can sure be a lot nicer than a stack trace. ;]
