Hi :D

Thanks for playing Taz. We hope that you enjoy this little game,
we enjoyed a lot make it.

The game is FREE SOFTWARE and it's hosted in [www.amazingcow.com] web page.
It means that you can HACK and SHARE it freely.

We have another cool projects at our site [www.amazingcow.com], take a look.

We dedicate this game to CVV – Centro de Valorização da Vida [http://www.cvv.org.br]
They helps people not commit suicide, and their work is very, very important.
Please take a time to checkout their site and see what you can do to help.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is built to work on both GNU/Linux and Windows 64-bit versions.
As we don't have any x86 boxes at time we can't verify if it'll work on non
64-bit machines.

The bundled versions (both GNU/Linux and Windows) are expected to work out
of the box without any further installations - To do so the size of binary
is increased a lot, that's a tradeoff that we can't avoid.

The non-bundled versions (again for both platforms) needs the
following requirements:

- Python: [https://www.python.org/]
- Pygame: [https://www.pygame.org/]
- NumPy:  [http://www.numpy.org/]

So follow your operating system instructions to install them. On Windows can
be a bit trick to get it working, in the other side most (if not all) GNU/Linux
distributions already came with python installed.

To install the other requirements on those distros follow those instructions:
1 - Open your terminal.
2 - Type (you'll need administrator rights to do so):
      sudo python -m ensurepip --upgrade {Hit enter}
      sudo pip install pygame numpy      {Hit enter}

Otherwise follow the instructions on the packages sites and if any of that work
please let us know by sending an email to [help_floss@amazingcow.com] with
the subject filled as: [Taz - Requirements]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's no installer provided for Windows platforms, the game is packaged in a
way that you can place it in any place that you might want to.

For GNU/Linux platforms there's is an install script named [install.sh] on
the Game directory, just run it in your terminal as administrator that the
game will be installed and a nice entry will appear on your desktop menu.
